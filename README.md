# 🍽️ FoodieMania – Public Demo

**FoodieMania** is a full-stack food ordering platform designed to offer a seamless experience for discovering restaurants, browsing menus, placing orders, and completing payments.

> 📝 This is a **minimal public demo** version of the project, focused on showcasing its architecture, folder structure, and tech stack. The full source code and core business logic are intentionally excluded to protect proprietary implementation.

## 👥 Role-Based Architecture

This project follows a clear separation of concerns with **role-based access** for:

- 🧑‍🍽️ **Users** – Browse restaurants, add to cart, place orders, track delivery
- 🛍️ **Sellers** – Manage dishes, update restaurant profiles, handle incoming orders
- 🛠️ **Admins** – Oversee platform activity, approve/reject sellers, manage content

## ✨ Features Included in This Demo

- Well-structured frontend & backend folder hierarchy
- React component-based UI structure with route layouts
- Protected route setup and session-aware navigation
- Modular backend API folder organization
- Role-based architecture (Users / Sellers / Admins)
- Placeholder screens and minimal logic to demonstrate flow
