# 🍽️ FoodieMania – Public Demo

**FoodieMania** is a full-stack food ordering platform designed to offer a seamless experience for discovering restaurants, browsing menus, placing orders, and completing payments.

> 📝 This is a **minimal public demo** version of the project, focused on showcasing its architecture, folder structure, and tech stack. The full source code and core business logic are intentionally excluded to protect proprietary implementation.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with session control
- **Payments**: Stripe integration + Cash on Delivery
- **Cloud Services**: Cloudinary for image uploads

---

## 👥 Role-Based Architecture

This project follows a clear separation of concerns with **role-based access** for:

- 🧑‍🍽️ **Users** – Browse restaurants, add to cart, place orders, track delivery
- 🛍️ **Sellers** – Manage dishes, update restaurant profiles, handle incoming orders
- 🛠️ **Admins** – Oversee platform activity, approve/reject sellers, manage content

---

## ✨ Features Included in This Demo

- Well-structured frontend & backend folder hierarchy
- React component-based UI structure with route layouts
- Protected route setup and session-aware navigation
- Modular backend API folder organization
- Role-based architecture (Users / Sellers / Admins)
- Placeholder screens and minimal logic to demonstrate flow
- Clean codebase prepared for full-scale extension

> 💡 This demo **does not** include full backend business logic, security middleware, or database operations. It’s meant purely for demonstration purposes.
